================
Just **init my work**. It's **not release** now.

Because I'm more familier with web development, and there is only one Macbook in my team (I'm so tired that all CCB should be made, and given vars and events , and create corresponding UI file, and bind the vars in code, by myself), we need a open tech for every platform to do the UI layout and binding work.
So I choosed HTML/CSS/JS to do this. 

In this Project, I'll made a **template** which can work in web browser to check if the design is good. **A web browser based exporter** to export the template to json.
( and in future I'll made the **UI designer** totally based on web browser)
And a **js/lua parser lib/codes ** to bind the json to cocos2d-x.
